   <h2>NextEra has solar plants containing covering thousands of acres and containing over 200,000 solar panels. It is not feasible to manually inspect each panel from the ground for defects.​</h2>
   <h3>Our proposed system is a dashboard to monitor solar fields for FPL and NextEra. ​</h3>
   <h3>With UAV metadata and ML model as input, the system will generate accurate and up-to-date geo-coordinates, maintain a count of damaged solar panel within a solar field, and remove any duplicate damaged panels between images from the count.</h3>​
